    <p>Hello Everyone! My name is Katie Alcazar.
        <br>
    I've taken a handful of classes here are Mesa College. I am so looking forward to this class. I was also in Professor Gibson's WEBD152 and had so much fun. It was my first
    coding class, and I was blown away by what I could do. I would show my family every little step as I accomplished it. I plan
    to grow my skills as I get settled into this field. I still don't understand a lot, but I'm getting a grasp of things. I am planning on getting my Associates in Web Development to then pursue a job in this field. Before starting at Mesa I took a digital design class in high school that just covered some Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. This is what initially peaked my interest in this general area, once I started at Mesa I thought that Web Development would be a good mix of a creative and practical career choice.

    I have made so many new friends these last two years. I've found a wonderful little group of people, many of them come from out of San Diego. They are all people who now love our city now and may make this a long term home. Some will leave in a couple years, but I won't forget what they have taught me--I especially won't forget the wonderful memories we've created. This sweet little crew has encouraged me to get out of my comfort zone, to start reaching out more to those around me.  They are all lovely people who all want good things for everyone around them. We push each other grow and seek what will make us happy. You need good people around you who want to grow and build good lives.

    I've worked in coffee for all my working years. It's been a great experience. I've been hiking more regularly
    as my boyfriend loves adventure and challenge, and I want to be there for it all. We have our yearly family camping trip coming up and are planning a couple trips with friends. It's going to be a blast!
    <br>
    So far this year we have no big trips planned but I've been to a handful of vacation spots in my life and I cherish those experiences with all my heart!

    <ul>
    <li>
        
        <p><strong> Costa Rica: </strong>Every year my mom goes on a big trip, usually to somewhere in Mexico. She was dreaming about Costa Rica and I jump at the chance to go on this trip with her. I felt like everything lined up, I was at a good young but grown age, I had a consistent job that would let me leave for a 10 day trip and only whish for me to enjoy my vacation. I was in a good spot financially. I am so glad i went on this trip with her, in full honesty I thought we would die due to the absolute lack of planning, but that is what made this trip so fun in the end.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Mexico City/Toluca: </strong> I have been to Mexico City a handful of times while growing up, since my family's' hometown is only a few hours away. My time in Mexico always humbled my old self who was very timid and didn't like new uncomfortable experiences, but once I got my feet went and saw that I would be okay, I had a jolly good time!. There also was a whole group of kids in my little neighborhood who always wanted to play, and i got meet all of our family over there. We would visit my grandparents home towns, and I got to see where my mom grew up. We would always go in March, during Holy Week. Holy Week, or Semana Santa, was always a huge party in Mexico. I never had celebrations like that here in the U.S.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Colorado: </strong>My most recent trip was a road trip to colorado in december. It was an 18 hour drive, most of which my boyfriend drove. A friend of our had a family house up there and my boyfriend had only been there in the summer. We had never seen snow like that. It was SNOWING. The drive was a little scary, especially getting up that mountain in the dark, but we woke up to a winter wonderland.</p></li>
